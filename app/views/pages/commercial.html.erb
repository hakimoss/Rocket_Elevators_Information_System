						<p> The historic status of this building meant extremely restricting guidelines for an expansion project. 
							Renowned architect Richard Rogers came up with a plan to connect three separate structures into one with an open-air elevator shaft 
							featuring glass walkways. ThyssenKrupp Elevators Americas designed, manufactured and installed the elevators for this project.
							 Some design aspects include an exposed red elevator track and scenic car with a seamless glass wall and ceiling configuration.

						<p>mproving energy conservation was the goal of the World Financial Center’s modernization project. 
							A total of 96 elevators were updated as part of a $250 million renovation endeavor. thyssenkrupp Elevator modernizations 
							achieve the largest potential for efficiency by reducing the energy used to operate the elevators. The project also marks 
							the first large-scale modernization in the region to feature thyssenkrupp Elevator’s Destination Dispatch, which directs passengers 
							to the elevator that will get them to their destination in the shortest travel time. This practice can reduce time to destination 
							by up to 30% compared to standard elevator control. Our energy-saving feature and equipment, combined with our long-term service 
							contract, support sustainability efforts and set new standards for eco-efficiency. In fact, One World Financial Center was recently
							 certified LEED Gold.</p>
